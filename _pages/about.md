- **Enthusiastic AI Researcher**
- **PhD Student at LMU Munich & Siemens**
- **Email**: chenshuo.cs at outlook dot com
- *Name Pronunciation: "Shuo" is similar to "shore" with a British accent.*

I am a 1st year PhD student at LMU Munich and Siemens AG, supervised by [Prof. Volker Tresp](https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~tresp/). Before that, I graduated from the [Elite Master of Data Science](https://www.m-datascience.mathematik-informatik-statistik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/) advised by [Prof. Volker Tresp](https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/~tresp/).

Before joining LMU, I graduated from [the School of Information Management](https://ischool.sysu.edu.cn/) at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen_University) (SYSU), Guangzhou, China, in 2020 with a major in Information Systems and a minor in Computer Science, advised by [Prof. Daifeng Li](https://ischool.sysu.edu.cn/cn/content/%E6%9D%8E%E5%B2%B1%E5%B3%B0).

My research interests include Deep Learning, Multimodal Models, Vision-Language Models, and Responsible AI.
