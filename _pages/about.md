I am about to graduate from [Elite Master of Data Science](https://www.lmu.de/de/studium/studienangebot/alle-studienfaecher-und-studiengaenge/data-science-master-hauptfach-4483.html) in [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/) and will embark on a PhD journey in the near future. 

Before joining in LMU, I graduated from the School of Information Management in Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou China in 2020, with a major in Information Systems and a minor in Computer Science.

My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Graphs and Model Robustness.
